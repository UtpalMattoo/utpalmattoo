## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Utpal, with professional work experience in: Engineering (except front-end development), Consulting (implementation and customer success) and Analytics.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on all things NLP, Data Science and Engineering, LLM/AI/Technical Operations, building proofs-of-concept


This GitHub profile has work I did outside of my day job.

- Research-type project work in NLP (using Python, Pandas, NumPy, PyTorch, Jupyter):

    * [Knowledge Extraction](https://github.com/UtpalMattoo/XCS224U_NLP/blob/main/UtpalMattoo_XCS224U_ProjectReport.pdf)
